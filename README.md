# Cadence (Server side application)

Uses pattern recognition algorithms on [`Cadence.js`](http://fillthisis.net/)
data for the purpose of recognizing users and authenticating them.

Analyze the "cadence" with which a user types a phrase to match and optionally
authenticate them.  This cadence data will be used in pattern recognition
algorithms to determine optimal classifiers for best separating the typing
patterns of users.  This project involves a web application and client side
library to process and capture user input.

## Usage

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```
